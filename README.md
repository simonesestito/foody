## Build

This project uses Docker Compose to perform tests. You need to install nothing but Docker on your system and you're ready to go.

You can also first build the Flutter app on your own with ```flutter build web```, then start the Node app with ```npm start```. A running MariaDB database is needed, so you'll need to configure it using env variables. Of course, Docker is easier because it's preconfigured.

## Documentation

The project documentation, specifically about the database structure, it's available in Italian at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/135rB56D_wniunaJxY9SCFpWHcEuFZqNz

## Technologies involved

Since it's a project for the "Databases" course, it's backed by a **MariaDB** database.

The server-side code is written using **TypeScript** and the **express.js** HTTP web framework to provide a REST API.

Frontend code is powered by **Flutter Web**.

Finally, deploy is performed accordingly to the [following section](#production-deploy)

## Production Deploy

It's been designed to be an easy app to deploy and try out, so it's just a single Docker image published on Docker Hub.

Since it also requires a database, you can run the ```docker-compose.yml``` configuration file to run this app in Docker Compose and it'll work out of the box.

You can edit the project, and rebuild it using the associated ```Dockerfile```, which bundles the Flutter Web app and the Typescript rest API all in a single Docker image.
